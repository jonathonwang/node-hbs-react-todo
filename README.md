# React Todo Project with Node API and MongoDB
**Work In Progress**: Still have a ton of work to do
## Setup:

1. Clone Repo `git clone`
2. Cd into directory and run `npm install`
3. Make sure you have mongo installed locally
4. Change the mongoose connection to your mongoDB in `db.js`
5. Wait until I have done more stuff and do a `git pull` when it is actually useable.
